# Taken together this means that the segment is not present in the graph file. This is a good thing.
# It means that the issue isn't in my pipeline, but rather in the original graph file.
# It may suggest that we are using a different version of the genome-graph than the one used to generate the .graph.methyl file.
# For now I will ignore this issue, but I will need to check with Wenjin as to what version of the genome-graph he used.

### This section will take in the ConversionCodeCounts.txt file and calculate the percent of each conversion code
# The percent is calculated by dividing the count of each conversion code by the total number of entries in the converted file
# The total number of entries is the sum of the counts of each conversion code which is the first column of the ConversionCodeCounts.txt file
# The output will be a tab delimited file with the conversion code in the first column and the count and fraction in the second and third columns respectively
# all of this after logging into the interactive node with 16GB of memory
